    "**The primary purpose of this notebook is to test the OpenEphys sorting \"pipeline\".\n",
    "Specifically, after defining your pathnames appropriately, this notebook will use SpikeInterface to perform spike sorting, analyze the sorting quality, and exports the results in \"Phy\" format. This output is then passed into pyramid to extract behavioral data, eye data, and spiking data to create a \"TrialFile\" which can be easily converted in Matlab to a user-friendly format, like FIRA, to perform subsequent analyses.**\n",

    "1) This should be run with VS code when your top level folder is /Lab_Pipelines/experiments/aodr/\n",
    "2) Can't find a module/package? Check if you have a jupyter conflict. If your jupyter notebook is local, it's looking for resources based on the local jupyter paths. We want our jupyter notebook to be working in the same environment we're using (gold_pipelines). This might pose problems for other work you do with jupyter, but I'm not sure yet (you might want to consider only installing jupyter in python environments). Check which jupyter you're using by typing \"which jupyter\" in a terminal with the gold_pipelines environment activated. If it references a jupyer that is located in \".../anaconda3/envs/gold_pipelines\" then you should be okay. If it's something else then you should try uninstalling jupyter:\n",
